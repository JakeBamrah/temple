        <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>
            Much of my experience has involved working across the entire web-stack.
            More recently however, I've found myself deeply interested in
            <i>systems programming</i>, along with the design of more performant
            software in general using <i>C</i>. This has been my point of
            focus for the last few months.
        </p>
